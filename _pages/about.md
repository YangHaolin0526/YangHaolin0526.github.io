Currently, I am working on building Large Language Models (LLM) and enable its usage in more application scenarios. Todays' LLMs are often extremely computation-expensive and difficult to control, which limits theirs usefulness. To make them user-friendly and accessible to more individuals and organizations, my research focus on: (1) make them better API's for various realistic problems; (2) build smaller but more specificalized LLM expert; (3) incorporate various input signals to them like image and video. 

I am an Undergraduate student majored in Data Science and Technology at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/).
